Fort Wendy's public git repository

So yeah this is the public GIT Repository belonging to Fort Wendy. It's definately not much as it is, but I'm hoping to improve on this in the coming months as my experience and knowledge of coding grows.

You can find more information about Fort Wendy on http://www.fort-wendy.com/

Follow me on twitter for periodic updates should you be interested. Also don't be afraid to provide critique here, on my blog or on twitter, I'm always looking to improve my skills and constructive criticism is welcome!

Also, if you are a graphics artist and are looking for work, contact me. Maybe we can work something out :)
